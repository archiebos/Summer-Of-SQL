--We want to stack the tables on top of one another, since they have the same fields in each sheet. We can do this one of 2 ways (help):
--Drag each table into the canvas and use a union step to stack them on top of one another
--Use a wildcard union in the input step of one of the tables

--Some of the fields aren't matching up as we'd expect, due to differences in spelling. Merge these fields together
--Make a Joining Date field based on the Joining Day, Table Names and the year 2023

--Now we want to reshape our data so we have a field for each demographic, for each new customer (help)
--Make sure all the data types are correct for each field
--Remove duplicates (help)
--If a customer appears multiple times take their earliest joining date
