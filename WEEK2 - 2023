-- In the Transactions table, there is a Sort Code field which contains dashes. We need to remove these so just have a 6 digit string (hint)
-- Use the SWIFT Bank Code lookup table to bring in additional information about the SWIFT code and Check the Digits of the receiving bank account (hint)
-- Add a field for the Country Code (hint)
--Hint: all these transactions take place in the UK so the Country Code should be GB
--Create the IBAN as above (hint)
--Hint: watch out for trying to combine string fields with numeric fields - check data types
--Remove unnecessary fields (hint)
